# NLIWOD
Collection of tools, utilities, datasets and approaches towards realising natural language interfaces for the Web of Data. 

This repository will soon include the following repositories as submodules:
* https://github.com/aksw/qa-ml
* https://github.com/aksw/qa-datasets
* https://github.com/aksw/qa-commons 
* https://github.com/aksw/hawk (?)

We aim at providing a fast entrance to the field of natural langauge interfaces (search, question answering, ranking). Thus, we will offer here Maven dependencies and source code for using many available datasets, systems and techniques. 

Foreseen modules:
* QA Features: Features calculated on a NL question to train ML algorithms.
* QA Systems: A set of existing online webservices of QA systems all executable via a simple Java interface.
