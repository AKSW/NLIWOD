# Machine Learning over Question Answering System

This project aims at combining different QA Systems to improve the overall performance.

## Available QA Systems on the Web

Currently, we work on log files provided from the QALD-6 challenge. In the future, we want to use several web services. Our experiment implementation is based on http://meka.sourceforge.net/
